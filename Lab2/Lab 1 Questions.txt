1. 4 Program errors and their usage:
    SIGFPE: Floating Point Exception
        This error reports arithmetic errors from division by zero to integer overflows.
        Probably the most important error signal there is.
    
    SIGSEGV: Segmentation Violation
        SIGSEGV is generated when a program tries to use more memory than allocated.
        For example, array[5] = 'a' when an array has length of 5.

     SIGABRT: Abort
        When a program aborts for whatever reason, this signal is called.

    SIGSYS: Bad System call
        Happens when a system call is executed but the system call does not exist.

2. 4 Termination Signals and usage:
    SIGINT: Interrupts
        Disrupt the execution of the program. Usually quits the program but can be handled.

    SIGQUIT: Quit
        SIGQUIT is similar to SIGINT but it creates a dump of the machine state.
        Using this would help immensively with debugging.
    
    SIGTERM: Terminates
        A signal to terminate a process. Unlike SIGKILL, this signal can be handled or blocked.
    
    SIGKILL: Kill
        Mercilessly stop a process from running. No exceptions.
        Used when a program won't respond to other termination signals, usually.

3. What signal is impossible to handle or ignore? Why?
    SIGKILL. It's necessary to have a signal that terminates a program that can't be blocked.
    Otherwise, the only way to stop execution for a bug or malicious program would be to turn the computer off.
